## üöß In Progress

### Stability & Optimization
- [ ] Evaluate robust enrichment pipeline using Google Books API (fallback: OpenLibrary)
- [ ] Implement consistent error handling and response schemas
- [ ] Normalize ingestion payloads across all endpoints
- [ ] Plan for tokenized access control (Cloudflare Access or JWT-based)

---

## üîú Future Milestones

### Ingestion & Enrichment (v0.2+)
- [ ] Scheduled enrichment jobs for metadata refresh (ISBN/ASIN)
- [ ] AI-generated summaries, character maps, themes, tags per work
- [ ] Bulk import via CSV or JSON upload
- [ ] Automated deduplication on ingestion with fuzzy matching logic

### Developer & Frontend Expansion (v0.3+)
- [ ] Advanced filtering: type, format, abridged, narrator
- [ ] Build public-facing frontend (Astro, React, or Next.js)
- [ ] Analytics for edition popularity, search trends, enrichment deltas
- [ ] API pagination and sorting options (limit, offset, order_by)

### Platform Engineering & Ecosystem (v0.4+)
- [ ] User accounts, saved libraries, private collections
- [ ] WASM-powered ISBN/ASIN validation or conversion helpers
- [ ] Smart search with AI-assisted intent recognition
- [ ] Community-driven metadata submission (moderated)
